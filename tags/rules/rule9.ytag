    title: "Rule 9"
---

    We do not provide support for these forks or ports, and they've been a big source of headaches for our support team. Trying to circumvent this rule by telling people to move to DMs or to non-support channels to talk about these forks or ports is still a violation of this rule. This rule was created because people constantly recommended broken Iris forks to people who probably shouldn't be using them in the support channels.
