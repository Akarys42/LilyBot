    Be decent to one another. We're all human. Any and all forms of bigotry, harassment, doxxing, exclusionary, or otherwise abusive behavior will not be tolerated. Excessive rudeness, impatience, and hostility are not welcome. Do not rage out or make personal attacks against other people. Do not encourage users to brigade/raid other communities.
