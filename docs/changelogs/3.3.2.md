# LilyBot 3.3.2

This update brings a couple of bug fixes to PluralKit and the help commands, as well as a couple of new features.
The full changelog can be found below.

* Allow PluralKit users to send proxies messages in support threads and not have the bot error trying to do so
* Add `/remind` to allow users to set remind command in discord
* Clean up message building but removing unnecessary usages of `.edit` builders and some useless functions
* Fixed a bug where Lily was being extra helpful with the help command. She will no longer increase the pages by 32 each time she is asked for help!
